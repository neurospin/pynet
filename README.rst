pynet
=====

Helper Module for Deep Learning with pytorch.

This work is made available by a community of people, amoung which the
CEA Neurospin BAOBAB laboratory.

Where to start
==============

You can list all available Deep Learning tools by executing in a Python shell::

    from pprint import pprint
    import pynet
    pprint(pynet.get_tools())

The 'get_tools' function returns a dictionary with all available 'networks',
'losses', 'regularizers', and 'metrics'.

Then each network has been embeded in a Deep Learning training interface.
Network parameters are set using the NetParameters object.
You can list all these interfaces by executing in a Python shell::

    from pprint import pprint
    import pynet
    pprint(pynet.get_interfaces(family=None))
    params = pynet.NetParameters(param1=1, param2=2)
    params.param3 = 3

The 'get_interfaces' function returns a dictionary with interfaces sorted by
family names. You can filter the result by providing the family name or a list
of family names of interest.

You can list also all available data fetchers by executing in a Python shell::

    from pprint import pprint
    import pynet.datasets import get_fetchers
    pprint(get_fetchers())

The 'get_fetchers' function returns a dictionary with all the declared
fetchers. Finally you may want to look at the data manger class that provides
convenient tools to split/stratify you dataset::

    from pynet.datasets import DataManager

Install
